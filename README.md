Task: 
Motor starts moving forward, it should keep going until it detects a wall 50cm away and while moving forward one LED should be on then at 50cm from the wall it should pause for like 3 seconds and start moving backwards at a slower speed with the other LED on

Cons: The code wrote for two motros but here I conected one motor only
